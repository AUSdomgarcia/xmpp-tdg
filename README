This package contains the sources of the code examples used in the book
"XMPP: The Definitive Guide" ( http://oreilly.com/catalog/9780596521264 ).
These examples can be used and modified at will, without requesting our
permission. 

These code samples serve illustrative purposes for the book only, so they
cannot be considered stable or usable in production. Making this code
robust is also not our primary goal, since that would require a lot of code 
that would only distract from the point we want to show. That said, we 
welcome bugreports or bug fixes for these code samples.

We refer to the README files in the code dirs for more information about usage
and/or caveats of the code.

Enjoy,
